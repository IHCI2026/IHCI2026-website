                    slogan: The 18th International Conference on Intelligent Human-Computer Interaction
                    description: |
                        Since 2008, the Intelligent Human-Computer Interaction (IHCI) community has advanced 
                        human-centered technology and cognitive computing. The 18th IHCI conference builds on 
                        this legacy by bringing technology and the humanities into closer conversation, deepening 
                        our understanding of how people think, create, and collaborate with intelligent systems. 
                        Through innovation and open collaboration, IHCI supports research and experimental 
                        development that led to more intuitive, effective, and satisfying user experiences.

                        IHCI 2026 will highlight innovative research and methodologies that increase usability, 
                        accessibility, and interaction efficiency. By uniting researchers, practitioners, engineers, 
                        designers, and industry leaders, the conference will address the pressing challenges of 
                        designing seamless, trustworthy, and human-centered interfaces that improve how we live, 
                        work, and learn with technology.
