talkTitle: "Data-Enabled Design for Smart Health Innovation"
talkAbstract: |
  With the rapid advancement of human-computer interaction and pervasive computing, diverse forms of data have come to play a pivotal role across various stages of intelligent product innovation. This development opens up significant opportunities for designers and design researchers to engage with real-world contexts through interdisciplinary approaches. Using the healthcare setting as an example, this keynote will illustrate how data can contribute to design innovation and foster meaningful user-system interactions, supported by several case studies.
