The IHCI 2026 Poster track showcases early-stage work, late-breaking results, novel ideas, design probes, and provocative viewpoints that stimulate discussion and promote collaboration. Posters are ideal for receiving feedback on emerging research and for highlighting work in progress, replication efforts, datasets, tools, or case studies.

We welcome poster submissions across the full IHCI scope, including human-AI interaction, XR, robotics, computer vision, accessibility, cybersecurity, social computing, arts and creative technologies, health and education applications, methods, and evaluation.

IHCI 2026 invites original research that advances human-centered interaction with intelligent systems.

Authors may optionally include a single-page portrait draft poster illustrating the work. Content must be original and not previously published; preliminary versions of ongoing work are welcome.

## Presentation Format & Publications

Posters will be displayed on site in A0 portrait (841 mm x 1189 mm or 36 x 48 inches) portrait format. Authors should bring printed posters; mounting supplies (pushpins or clips) will be provided. At least one author must register and be present at the poster session.

Accepted poster abstracts will be published in the IHCI 2026 proceedings. Best Poster and Best Student Poster awards will be selected by the Program Committee.
