The 18th International Conference on Intelligent Human-Computer Interaction (IHCI 2026) invites original research that advances human-centered technology and deepens our understanding of how people interact with intelligent systems. We welcome interdisciplinary work spanning HCI, including AI, robotics, science & engineering, arts and music, with a strong emphasis on ergonomics, human factors, usability, accessibility, ethics, and real-world impact.

## Topics of Interest

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

-   Human-AI interaction and explainability; trustworthy, ethical, and responsible AI
-   Robotics, human-robot interaction, and embodied interfaces
-   Computer vision and vision-based interaction
-   Mixed/Virtual/Augmented reality; spatial computing; cybersickness
-   Human factors and ergonomics; Evaluation methods for interaction at scale
-   Social computing, collaborative interactions
-   Embodied agents, virtual humans, avatars and multimodal interaction
-   Arts, music, and creative technologies
-   Cybersecurity, privacy, and safety for interactive systems
-   Interactive, ubiquitous, and wearable computing; IoT and smart environments
-   Accessibility, inclusive design, and assistive technologies
-   Affective and cognitive computing; behavior modeling
-   Design methods, prototyping, evaluation, and reproducible HCI
-   Education, healthcare, sustainability, transportation, and other application domains
-   Human-environment interaction and situated interfaces

## Important Dates

All deadlines are 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth).

-   **Paper Submission Deadline**: 14 August 2026
-   **Notification of Decisions**: 4 September 2026
-   **Camera-Ready Submission Deadline**: 11 September 2026

## Submission Guidelines

IHCI 2026 invites original research that advances human‑centred interaction with intelligent systems. Each paper should have a clear contribution in one or more of the following types:

-   **Methodological/Technical**: New theories, models, measures, study designs, analysis/evaluation methods, algorithms, interaction techniques, sensors/devices, software/hardware toolkits, or data pipelines that improve user experience in HCI. Examples include reliable UX metrics, protocols for human–AI studies, participatory and inclusive design methods, multimodal input, haptics, adaptive interfaces, and privacy‑preserving interactions.

-   **Application/System**: Applying HCI to real‑world problems or presenting end‑to‑end interactive systems, platforms, datasets, benchmarks, or infrastructures that enable HCI research and practice. Include an evaluation (e.g., user studies or field deployments) and discuss architecture, usability, scalability; share artefacts when possible. Domains include health, education, accessibility, sustainability, public services, and industry.

-   **Industry**: Practitioner reports on challenges, processes, and impact at scale, such as productised HCI, experimentation platforms, accessibility programmes, and responsible AI practices. Emphasise outcomes and lessons learned.

### Format

All submissions must follow the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) template and be submitted electronically as a single PDF in English.

## Review Process

All submissions will receive multiple expert peer reviews. Final decisions may include acceptance, conditional acceptance with revision, or rejection. Evaluation criteria include originality, significance, methodological soundness, clarity of presentation, and contribution to HCI. At least one author must register and be present at the oral session.

## Publications & Special Issues

{{< springer-lncs >}}

Accepted papers will be included in the IHCI 2026 proceedings, published digitally in Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) by Springer. The proceedings will be indexed in Scopus, Google Scholar, DBLP, the ACM Digital Library, and other relevant databases. Best Paper and Best Student Paper awards will be selected by the Program Committee. Authors are encouraged to share artifacts (e.g., data, code, and materials) when possible.

Authors of accepted papers may expand their manuscripts by at least 50% and have the option to submit them to the following Special Issues:

-   [Sensors: Sensors Fusion in Digital Healthcare Applications](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues/sensors_fusion_digital_healthcare)
-   [Electronics: Interactive Design for Autonomous Driving Vehicles](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/electronics/special_issues/VXM004D5IVn")
