The IHCI 2026 Demo track features live, interactive demonstrations of research systems, artifacts, tools, and experiences. Demos enable hands-on engagement and are an excellent way to showcase technical contributions, novel interaction techniques, creative works, and translational prototypes from labs and industry.

We welcome demos across HCI and intelligent systems, including but not limited to human-AI systems and copilots, robotics and embodied interaction, XR experiences, tangible interfaces, data physicalization, healthcare and accessibility technologies, security and privacy tools, creative/arts installations, and educational technologies.

## Important Dates

All deadlines are 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth).

- **Demo Submission Deadline**: 14 August 2026
- **Notification of Decisions**: 4 September 2026
- **Camera-Ready Demo Paper Deadline**: 11 September 2026

## Submission Guidelines

Submissions must include a demo extended abstract of 2-4 pages (excluding references; references may take up to 1 additional page). The extended abstract should include a technical summary describing equipment, space, power/network needs, setup time, safety considerations, and whether you can bring backup hardware.

Authors may optionally include a video of up to 3 minutes, showing the system in use and setup and include captions.

Optional: A poster or handout to accompany the demo on-site. At least one author must be registered and presented during the demo session.

## On-Site Logistics & Publications

The conference will provide a table, power, and Wi-Fi per demo; specialized equipment (e.g., VR headsets, robots) should be provided by the authors. Please detail any hazardous components or special requirements in your submission; approvals may be required. Load-in and technical checks will occur prior to the demo sessions.

Accepted demo extended abstracts will be published in the IHCI 2026 proceedings.
